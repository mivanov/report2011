              2011 was the first year of the LocalWiki project.  Between
              rampant coding, community building and traveling, it's been
              quite a whirlwind.  Now we report back on our first year and
              look toward the future.

<p>
Wow, what a year!  
</p>
<p>
As some of you know, this project had been brewing in our collective heads for many years now. 
</p>
<p>
In 2004 we started the Davis Wiki, an experimental project to collect and share interesting information about the town of Davis, California.  We wanted the Davis Wiki to be a sort of collective, ever-updating “community brain” that would contain anything and everything about the town.  So, unlike most websites, the Davis Wiki would be editable by anyone.
</p>
<p>
What we wanted didn’t exist, so we built it.  We found some open-source “wiki” software and spent the next several months extensively customizing it to make it easier to use, more aesthetically pleasing and have some specific functionality we thought was important in Davis.
</p>
<p>
As the years passed, the Davis Wiki grew and grew and grew &mdash; and it’s now the largest, most used media source in the community.  But the recurring question always was: how do we help other communities create resources as amazing as the Davis Wiki?  The LocalWiki project is our attempt to answer that question.
</p>
<p>
A little over a year ago we were awarded a grant from the Knight Foundation and simultaneously launched a successful Kickstarter campaign to help fund essential community outreach.  Shortly thereafter we were able to begin what we’d only ever dreamed about before: to devote serious energy and resources toward bringing something as amazing as the Davis Wiki to other communities.
</p>
<p>
Just as in the early days of the Davis Wiki, the majority of our early work was technical in nature.  We spent most of our first six months working on software and spreading the word about the project.  The end result?  A new kind of wiki software designed, from the ground up, for local communities.
</p>
<p>
Over the next six months, while still writing code at a breakneck speed, we kicked off the nimble beginnings of our pilot community project.  We solicited recommendations for communities around the world and received over 300 formal inquires.  With our limited resources in mind, we began working with just a few communities off the bat.
</p>
<p>
Our goal with the pilot program was two-fold: to get essential feedback on our new software as it was being developed, and to help steward communities through the process of creating a new local wiki project.  Our aim was to help develop focused efforts: we’d rather have a few strong, thriving projects than hundreds of projects with no momentum or quality content.
On November 1st, 2011, our first local wiki pilot, DentonWiki, formally launched to the public.  Coinciding with that launch was the first major, easy-to-install release of our new LocalWiki software.
</p>
<p>
Where are we at now?  We’re working with 6 pilot communities, with many more partnerships in the pipeline.  Several of our pilots are close to launching, and our new open-source software is rapidly being adopted around the world.
</p>
<p>
It’s impossible to detail everything that’s happened over the past year, but we hope to give you a glimpse at where we’re at and where we want to go.  And, most importantly, we want to take the time to thank you.  Without you believing in us and believing in the promise of collaborative, community media, none of this would have been possible.
</p>
<p>
Thank you<br/>
Philip &amp; Mike

              We built something so easy to use that anyone can contribute.
              </h1>
<p>
Davis, CA is one of the United States’ last true college towns and is the second-most educated city in the country.  It’s no surprise, then, that in 2004 residents were able to learn the complex syntax and process behind contributing to the Davis Wiki.
</p>
<p>
With LocalWiki, we wanted to make sure that anyone could contribute &mdash; not just those who were technically savvy.  Why?  Because everybody benefits from a more usable, accessible resource!  And on the local level, everybody’s an expert.  In Davis, somewhere around one in seven residents have contributed to the DavisWiki.  On Wikipedia, only 0.02% of those who visit ever make an edit.
</p>
<p>
A lot has happened since 2004.  Products like Google Docs have mainstreamed rich, web-based collaboration.  Unfortunately, open-source wiki software hasn’t generally kept up with the rapid pace of technological innovation.  With our new software, we set out to do more than simply create a locally-focused wiki engine, but also to radically advance the state of the art in wiki software.

              place</h1>
              <p>
We knew that mapping should be at the heart of LocalWiki.  To that end, we developed a state of the art collaborative mapping system that’s really, really easy to use.  Pages can have maps with points, lines and areas &mdash; and anyone can edit a map just like editing a page.  And we even developed what may be the world’s first geographic difference algorithm to make it really easy to see what’s changed.

<p>
In November, a police officer pepper-sprayed students sitting in the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/The_Quad" target="_blank">UC Davis Quad</a>, kicking off a maelstrom of international media attention. But while the world's presses buzzed, Davis residents were busy compiling every bit of information about the event on their local wiki, <a href="http://daviswiki.org/The_Quad" target="_blank">DavisWiki.org</a>. Residents created an ever-updating chronology of events; posted and analyzed photos, videos and letters; discussed and debated the events; and countered incorrect information that was rapidly circulating.
</p>
<p>
Even before the event occurred, the DavisWiki had extensive pages about the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/UC_Davis_Police_Department" target="_blank">UC Davis Police Department</a>, the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/Linda_Katehi" target="_blank">UC Davis Chancellor</a>, the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/Annette_Spicuzza" target="_blank">head of the police department</a>, and the <a href="http://daviswiki.org/The_Quad">location of the event</a>. With the DavisWiki, residents were able to share and learn about an important event in its full context, not just consume the latest new updates.
</p>
<p>
During the week of the event, over 25,000 people visited pages on DavisWiki related to the pepper spraying, and the page about the event was edited over 700 times by over 100 different residents. But residents didn't simply read and share online &mdash; they turned this information into real-world action, including the largest protest in the city’s history.

                <p>At this point I can no longer avoid giving a first, 
pr      ovisional statement of my own hypothesis concerning the origin of the 
“b      ad conscience”: it may sound rather strange and needs to be pondered, 
li      ved with, and slept on for a long time. I regard the bad conscience as
 t      he serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress of 
th      e most fundamental change he ever experienced—that change which 
oc      curred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of 
so      ciety and of peace. The situation that faced sea animals when they 
we      re compelled to become land animals or perish was the same as that 
wh      ich faced these semi-animals, well adapted to the wilderness, to war, 
to       prowling, to adventure: suddenly all their instincts were disvalued 
an      d “suspended.” From now on they had to walk on their feet and “bear 
th      emselves” whereas hitherto they had been borne by the water: a 
dr      eadful heaviness lay upon them. They felt unable to cope with the 
si      mplest undertakings; in this new world they no longer possessed their 
fo      rmer guides, their regulating, unconscious and infallible drives: they
 w      ere reduced to thinking, inferring, reckoning, coordinating cause and 
ef      fect, these unfortunate creatures; they were reduced to their 
“c      onsciousness,” their weakest and most fallible organ! I believe there 
ha      s never been such a feeling of misery on earth, such a leaden 
di      scomfort and at the same time the old instincts had not suddenly 
ce      ased to make their usual demands. Only it was hardly or rarely 
po      ssible to humor them: as a rule they had to seek new and, as it were, 
su      bterranean gratifications.</p>

              <p>PARIS, Jan. 6—Albert Camus, one of France’s ranking writers and winner of a
              Nobel Prize for Literature, was buried today in a cemetery not far from the country home
              he recently bought in the village of Lourmarin in the south of France.</p>
              <p>It was while motoring from Lourmarin to Paris last Monday that the Algerian-born writer
              was killed when the car he was in went out of control and crashed into a tree at the side
              of a highway, seventy-five miles southeast of Paris.</p>
